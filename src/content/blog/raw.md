Today's App Case Study is Raw. Recently I have talked to one of the manager at a gaming & app publishing company and helping them conducting market research in the social media in the US. It is a popular European social media for Gen Z planning to expand to the US.

One of the keyword pop-up in our conversation was "Genuine". In the midst of social media, how should we navigate the genuine connections and help young generation find a real people they can trust and rely on internet? Many of people are skeptical, and yet it's not quite possible. Through this app analysis, I am going to share what types of possibilities of connecting people with 'real' intention on internet exist.

After researching about social media application, we found various platforms that focused on a value of authenticity. *R*AW was one of them.

Simply put, RAW is a mixture of BeReal and Tinder. Like how BeReal ask you to take back and front of picture through dual camera, RAW works in a same way. By showing your real time picture without filter or made-up-self, and Viceversa, you are able to share your true self.
